            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>KCAIT (Kenton COunty Academies for Inovation and Technology) is a program located in Kenton County Kentucky where high school students are given the oppertunity to get a head start in a field of their choosing. When you join the academies you are asked to pick a academy to join (Informatics, Media Arts, BioMed, Green Engineering, Robotics, Military Prep, Structural Engineering, Gemini, Womens Engineering, and Future Educators). After you have picked an academy you would have a special class that would focus on that field. For instance if you choose Infromatics you would have a informatics focused class where you might learn a computer language. Through out the school year we worked on a project of our choosing then we would present this project infront of a panel of judges who are experts on that field.</p>
            <h3>What did I do there?</h3>
