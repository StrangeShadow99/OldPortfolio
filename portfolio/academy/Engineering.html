        <h2>Focuses on the application of computer science and engineering to the creation of automated machines.</h2>
        <h4>The goal of the Robotics Academy is to introduce students to the robotics aspect of engineering and 
            the design process involved in that, by implementing sketches and CAD software into creating robots. 
            The academy is held in the mornings at Simon Kenton HS. Scholars in this academy will take one 
            mathematics class, one English class, and a Principles of Engineering class, taught by Ian Olano, 
            Alyssa Leimenstoll, and Adam Klaine, respectively. Students applying can expect to use 3D printers and 
            various CAD (computer animated design) programs and software. For projects, students will be expected 
            to innovate a new product.
